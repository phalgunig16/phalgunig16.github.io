								<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
								<p>An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has produced a global public health danger. As of November 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 65 million, with more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide [1]. Various countries and health organisations mainly specify the contact, respiratory droplet, or through inanimate objects routes as modes of transmission [2]. According to several studies, close contact (direct/indirect) and large respiratory or saliva droplets are the major human-to-human transmission paths, but there is still uncertainty about the aerosol and fecal-oral and further research is required. Recently there has been some growing evidence of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under certain specific conditions restricted by poor ventilation, longer exposure, and high concentration of aerosols, prompting health organisations to review their health guidelines and suggested preventive measures.</p>
								<p>The report aims to calculate evidence for COVID-19 aerosol transmission in an urban bus taking into consideration various conditions like relative humidity, ventilation, etc. and based on the results recommend control measures in an informational infographic to minimize the potential spreads of SARS-CoV-2 to advise the global scientific response to COVID-19 targeting the public.</p>
								
								<h2>RESULTS</h2>
								<p>The calculations show that the free-falling droplets evaporate rapidly in few seconds to dry droplet nuclei and remain suspended for a long time and could be transported over long distances by air.
									Figure 1. shows the change in diameter of particle decreasing with time for droplets initially of 5 µm, 20 µm, and 100 µm at different relative humidity. It can be observed that smaller droplets evaporate faster. At 61% RH, a 5 µm droplet evaporates completely in nearly 0.036s, a 20 µm droplet in about 0.57s, and a 100 µm droplet in 14.25s. It can be seen that with the increase in relative humidity the time of evaporation increases. This is due to an increase in the concentration gradient (Cs - Cꚙ) which drives the evaporation. The droplets quickly reach their terminal velocity and slow down due to their small size. The time taken by the particle to fall 1m vertically decreases as the particle size decreases. On comparing the time scales we find that particles smaller than 70 µm evaporate before they settle. Under normal conditions most of the particles released from the respiratory system evaporate to a size smaller than 5-20 µm, suggesting that the particles do not settle in >1m and stay airborne in the bus for a longer time, likely to be inhaled. This suggests that social distancing is not an effective preventive measure. More droplets would suspend in the air at lower relative humidity, increasing the probability of inhalation.</p>
								<p>These observations suggest that opening windows and limiting vocalization can greatly reduce the number of particles generated from breathing and talking. If everyone on the bus is wearing a mask, social distances, limits vocalization and the ventilation of the closed spaces is improved, the spread of infection can be controlled.</p>
